					<h3>jeonju</h3>
					
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/jeonju02.jpg" alt="" /></span>In Jeonju, Most famous place is Jeonju Hanok village Jeonju Hanok village is especially beautiful for its roof curves. The roof edges being slightly raised to the sky is unique. Hanok houses are generally divided into two sections, Anchae and Sarangchae. Anchae is also known as Gyusu room, and is furnished accordingly. Sarangchae is where the men dwell, and is referred to as the Seonbi room. Because men and women have to remain separate, Anchae is situated deep inside the house so that it is secretive and quiet. </p>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/jeonju03.jpg" alt="" /></span>Another trait of Hanok is that all the houses are heated with the ondol system, a unique sub-flooring heating system. Since Koreans enjoy sitting, eating, and sleeping on the floor, it needs to remain heated. A part of Hanok has been set aside so that tourists can experience traditional Korean life, called Hanok Life Experience Hall. You can enter the Seonbi room and the Gyusu room to experience the warm floor first-hand. An advantage of this system is that it is warm in the winter and cool in the summer. The food provided is very traditional, which adds to the traditional ambience. At Jeonju Hanok Village, visitors can enjoy traditional Korean life and traditional foods like bibimbap, the most well known dish from the Jeonju region.</p>

									<h3>gyeongju</h3>
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/gyeongju.jpg" alt="" /></span>There has been human settlement at and around the site of the present-day town of Kyongju from the prehistoric period. The Shilla clan became the rulers of the south-eastern part of the peninsula in 57 BCE. They chose Kyongju as their capital. There followed a long period of internal struggles between rival kingdoms. With the help of the Tang Dynasty in China, the Shilla Kingdom defeated its rivals in the 7th century and established its rule over most of the peninsula; this remained unchallenged until the beginning of the 10th century.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/gyeongju3.jpg" alt="" /></span>The Shilla rulers embellished their city with many public buildings, palaces, temples, and fortresses. Their tombs are to be found in the surroundings of the ancient city.
Mahayana Buddhism spread from China into Korea during the course of the 7th century and was adopted by the Shilla Kingdom. Mount Namsan, which had been venerated by the existing cults of Korea, became a Buddhist sacred mountain and attracted its adherents, who employed the most outstanding architects and craftsmen of the day to create temples, shrines, and monasteries.
With the end of the Shilla Kingdom, Korea underwent a further period of internal strife. It was unified again under Korean rule by the Yi (Chosun) Dynasty, which reigned until 1910. However, the country was invaded and devastated by the Japanese in the late 16th century and the Manchu in the 18th century, before being annexed by Japan in 1910. Throughout this long period, Kyongju has maintained its urban identity, though many of its major buildings have suffered degradation and demolition.nd General Kim Yu-sin.</p>

									<h3>busan</h3>
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/busan2.jpg" alt="" /></span>South Korea's second-largest city -- it's home to 3.7 million residents -- Busan is filled with towering apartments, crowded streets, and a modern subway system. That description may remind you a bit of Seoul, but don't be fooled -- this is a very different city. The people of Busan are in some ways more formal and traditional, but in other ways more easygoing and open. Busan's residents are not what you'd expect of those living in a modern metropolis, exhibiting the same friendliness you'll encounter in most rural towns, but that's just part of the city's charm.</p>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/busan3.jpg" alt="" /></span>The area around Busan's ports bustles with energy as boats arrive daily from all over Asia, and nearby Nampo-dong is home to the massive Jagalchi seafood market. The tourist center of Haeundae boasts some of the country's finest resort hotels, while the Seomyeon neighborhood is a paradise for shoppers. The old city center, Dongnae, in the north toward the mountains, is a great place to experience hot springs and Korean-style bathhouses. 
It can thank its major international port for its modern growth, and its cultural festivals and natural seaside beauty for its attraction as a major tourist destination. I hope you'll enjoy not just the beaches and cafe culture here, but the genuine warmth and hospitality of the people.</p>

									<h4>yeosu</h4>
									
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/yeosu2.jpg" alt="" /></span>Yeosu, meaning "good water in Korean," is a maritime city renowned for its pristine coastal scenery and a seemingly endless stretch of coastline. The city has become a rising tourist destination since hosting the 2012 World Expo, which promoted the importance of marine resources worldwide.

There are big aquarium called Hanhwa aqua planet. It has four exhibition halls - marine life, aqua forest, ocean life and alive museum. In main water tank, there are some performances such as synchronized swimming and Pierrot's acrobatic.
Manseongri Beach, with volcanic 'black' sand near Yeosu that is popular with Korean tourists. There are public showers and restrooms as well as on-duty lifeguards. Many restaurants located along the beach have beach-side tables and serve various seafood dishes. It is also possible to take ferries to many local islands for an authentic taste of rural Korea.</p>

					<h4>jeju</h4>
					
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/jeju2.jpg" alt="" /></span>Jeju Island, also known as the "Island of the Gods," is a popular vacation spot for Koreans and foreigners. It remains the top honeymoon destination for Korean newlyweds. Despite attempts to market the island as "the Hawaii of Korea," climatologically and geographically it bears little in similarity to the Hawaiian Islands in the U.S. The island offers visitors a wide range of activities: hiking on Halla-san (South Korea's highest peak) or Olle-gil(routes), catching sunrises and sunsets over the ocean, riding horses, touring all the locales from a favorite television K-drama, or just lying around on the sandy beaches.</p>
                       <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/jeju3.jpg" alt="" /></span>The local traditional culture stands in stark contrast to the mainland (and much of Asia) as being matriarchal. Stemming from this basis, and some odd tax reasons, the role of seafood gathering on the island has been dominated by women. As such, a common sight around Jeju's coastline is that of the "haenyo" or "woman diver", a figure that has become somewhat iconic of the island. Perhaps even more iconic are the "dol hareubang" or "grandfather statues", giant basalt statues. You will often see them outside restaurants, plus a few are thrown into any tourism site for good measure.</p>
